                        <p>
                            I built this app because I wanted to better understand SAML and I wanted to know how to discover, exploit, and remediate vulnearbilities associated with implementations. I created an easily deployable docker environment <a href="https://github.com/yogisec/VulnerableSAMLApp">here</a> that can be spun up on a local machine in about 5 minutes. I also have instructions to split the deployment across multiple hosts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This includes a fully functional IDP and a Service Provider. The Service Provider has several configuration options that allow for post deployment on the fly adjustments to the security stance of the application. When its fully deployed the environment will be similar to the architecture and data flows below:

                        <p>
                            For this scenario we are Yogi Bear. The Jellystone park staff have had enough of our stealing of picnic baskets. In an effort to track this behavior they have setup "Yogi's Saml App". This application allows park visitors to file complaints about our behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our goal as Yogi is to gain administrative access to the application via SAML implementation errors and delete the complaints. If we fail there is a possibility that we will be relocated to another park with no picnic baskets.
                        </p>

                            <h4 id="quick">Quick and Easy Deployment</h4>
                            The easiest way to get everything up and running is by cloning the repository and then simply running a quick docker-compose command. The compose command will build the images, and deploy them to the local host.

                            <pre><code>
                                git clone https://github.com/yogisec/VulnerableSAMLApp.git<br />
                                cd VulnerableSAMLApp<br />
                                sudo docker-compose up
                            </code></pre>

                            The Service Provider will be listening on <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000</code>. The IDP will be listening at <code>http://127.0.0.1</code>. Head down to the <a href=#features>Features</a> section for login details and more information about the applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h4 id="split">Split Host Deployment</h4>
                            In order to split the deployment across two seperate hosts (one an IDP, and the other a SP). We need to change some configuration details.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First clone the repository onto both hosts: 
                            <pre><code>
                                git clone https://github.com/yogisec/VulnerableSAMLApp.git<br />
                                cd VulnerableSAMLApp<br />
                                </code></pre>
                            On the host that will become the IDP run the <code>configure_platform.py</code> script. Work through the prompts filling in the information as requested to make the necessary edits to the IDP configuration files.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            python3 configure_platform.py
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            If you had the script build the docker container for you run the container with the following command and then skip down to configure the SP:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            sudo docker run -it --rm --name idp -d -p 80:80 idp:1.0
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            If you did not let the script build the container we need to build it. We can do that with the following command:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            cd vulnerableidp<br />
                            sudo docker build -t idp:1.0 .
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            This will build a container with the name <code>idp</code> and the tag <code>1.0</code>. Next run the container with:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            sudo docker run -it --rm --name idp -d -p 80:80 idp:1.0
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Confirm the container is running by running:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            sudo docker ps
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            If its running we should see an output similar to:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>

                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            We can confirm the IDP is listening by running curl:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            curl http://127.0.0.1
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Next on the Service Provider host run the <code>configure_platform.py</code> script. Work through the prompts filling in the information as requested to make the necessary edits to the application configuration files.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            python3 configure_platform.py
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            If you had the script build the docker container for you run the container with the following command and then skip down to the Features section to learn about the application:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            sudo docker run -it --rm --name sp -d -p 80:80 sp:1.0
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            If you did not let the script build the container we need to build it. We can do that with the following command:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            cd vulnerablesp<br />
                            sudo docker build -t sp:1.0 .
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            This will build a container with the name <code>sp</code> and the tag <code>1.0</code>. The next step is to run the container. This can be done with:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            sudo docker run -it --rm --name sp -d -p 8000:8000 sp:1.0
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            We can confirm the container is running by issuing:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            sudo docker ps
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            This should produce an ouput similar to this:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            94476aee1abf    sp:1.1    "uwsgi --ini vulnsp.â€¦"   4 minutes ago    Up 4 minutes    0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp    sp
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            We can confirm the application is up and listening by curling the interface with:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
                            curl http://127.0.0.1:8000
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            At this point the IDP and the SP should be up and running and accessible. The next section will provide an overview of some of the features of the application.

                            Additional Note: When changing from one scenario to the next it is best to make sure you signed out before adjusting the security levels of the Service Provider (SP). This helps to ensure there are no unforseen outcomes.

                            For this scenario we'll use the security configuration pictured below.

                            Before we get to far into this scenario, I wanted to take a moment and say that this scenario, this configuration issue, is the <b>MOST</b> common implementation flaw that I come across.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once we authenticate to our IDP we can make any changes to the SAML response that we want. The message will not be checked, the SP will simply process it as valid. The screenshot below shows the original assertion before tamper:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../static/images/Web_Things/saml/nothing_orig_assertion.png" alt="nothing_orig_assertion" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>
                            Now, if we change our user group to the <code>administrators</code> group as pictured below we will successfully escalate our privileges from a regular user account to a full admin within the SP.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../static/images/Web_Things/saml/nothing_tamper_assertion.png" alt="nothing_tamper_assertion" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>
                            Once we pass the SAML response payload along to the SP we are now an administrator within the SP and as we can see below when we click on the <code>complaints</code> tab we now have the ability to delete all of the complaints.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../static/images/Web_Things/saml/nothing_delete_options.png" alt="nothing_delete" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>
                            We can even take it a step further if we'd like and replace all of the fields within the response with fake information similar to the picture below. As the SP logs our 'malicious' doings it will log all of our fake information. The only true way to determine who we were before changing our use settings would be to sync up the logs from the IDP and the SP to determine who authenticated to the IDP before the malicious activity began.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Above I mentioned that this configuration is the most common issue that I find when testing SAML implementations. The reason for this is because when most applications are initially configured to leverage saml the check box to make sure messages are secure is left unchecked. This allows the owners to validate that all of the backend configuration that occurs between the SP and the IDP is correctly configured without dealing with certificates. The unfortunate part is most of the time this is where things get left. The messages are left fully vulnerable to anyone who can authenticate to the IDP.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="valid_assertion">Valid Assertion / Valid Message / Both</h3>
                        <p>
                            For this scenario we'll use the security configuration pictured below. This scenario plays out the exact same way if validMessage is also checked, or if it is checked and validAssertion is not.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../static/images/Web_Things/saml/valid_assertion_config.png" alt="valid_assertion_config" class="img-fluid">
                        
                        <p>
                            On the surface this seems like the ideal configuration. The Service Provider is checking for valid assertions, any tampering with the assertion attributes results in the message being rejected. In the picture below we have authenticated as the Yogi user account, and our assertion payload includes attributes about our account including our group membership 'users'.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We can attempt change the group membership to another group such as the 'administrators' group in the photo below.

                        <p>
                            Unfortunatly as we can see below the message is rejected because its not valid.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is a big security flaw with this configuration. The SP is only checking that the assertion is valid IF its signed. The application does not have signed messages as a requirement. If we remove the entire <code>signature</code> block from our SAML payload the message can be changed
                        </p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p>
                            Things are slightly improving with this deploymen. With this configuration the Assertion and/or Message must be signed. Since the application requires a signature we cannot just remove the signature block like we did in the previous scenario. To prove all of this out we will use the configuration below:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../static/images/Web_Things/saml/signed_config.png" alt="signed_config" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>
                            The first thing we can try is to simply remove the signature elements. We wont tamper with anything, just a quick test to see if we can remove the signatures and have the SAML response still be accepted by the SP.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../static/images/Web_Things/saml/signed_signature_removed.png" alt="signed_signature_removed" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>
                            As expected with our current configuration settings the SP rejects the response payload because it is invalid.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../static/images/Web_Things/saml/signed_error.png" alt="signed_error" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>
                            Perhaps we can leave the signature elements in the response message but change the assertion attributes? Below we can see the memberOf attribute value has been changed from the <code>users</code> group to the <code>administrators</code> group.   
                        </p>
                        <img src="../static/images/Web_Things/saml/signed_changed_group.png" alt="signed_group_change" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>
                            Sending the response payload along and we are greated with a successful login as well as our new permissions as a member of the administrators group!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Why did that work? The application is checking for signatures isn't it? Well it is and it isn't. The application in its current configuration is checking to make sure there are signature attributes within the SAML response and that it is signed with the trusted certificate. It's not actually checking if they are valid or not. If the signature elements are in the message the application assumes its legitimate and trust worthy. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In this scenario we'll use the following configuration:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This configuration is what is expected when deploying an application leveraging SAMl authentication. In this setup the SP requires that the messages are signed and that the signatures match the data in the overall message and the assertion. This means as an attacker we cannot tamper with the areas of the message which are used to calculate the signatures. This includes the attribute values within the assertion. Let's try out a couple things and see the outcomes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>There is a known bug with this deployment where when the application requires signed messages it will error on an attempt to sign out after a valid log in. The current work around is to either delete the session cookies, or to lower the security settings of the application by removing the requirement for signed messages to complete the log out. In the case of this application leaving the application with a requirement for the Assertions to be signed produces the same effect as also requirin the messages to be signed.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lets try to remove the signature of the SAML response:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This results in the error below, because the application is checking to see if the message is signed.
                        </p>

                            Lets leave the signature but change the attribute values within the assertion.
                        </p>

                            This results in another error. This is because the application is configured to make sure the messages are valid if they are signed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In February of 2018 DUO labs release details about vulnerabilities in 6 libraries that application leverage to use for SAML. This includes the library used as the source for this application. The original article is <a href="https://duo.com/blog/duo-finds-saml-vulnerabilities-affecting-multiple-implementations">here</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At a high level, you can add a comment in the middle of the XML assertion to change the attributes/values of the SAML response. The really damaging part of this is that depending on the library being used the comment may be ignored during the signature calculation of the message. So to the SP the message is still valid. For this application we'll need to lower our security settings in order to become vulnerable to this attack. The configuration is below:
                        </p>

                            For this scenario we'll pivot away from the 'Yogi' user account and use the Barney Rubble (brubble) user account. Imagine that Barney is an employee who has 'power user' permissions within the Service Provider. He doesn't have full admin rights so deleting comments isn't avaialble to him. One of the things that he is allowed to do is create groups! He created a group called 'administratorsbutnot' and added his user account to the group. Lets see how the scenario plays out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First we'll log in and confirm the group membership is correct, and that as Barney we do not have the ability to delete comments.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Now we will sign out and back in again, this time changing the SAML response to comment out the 'butnot' portion of the group membership like this: <code>administrators&#x3c;&#x21;&#x2d;&#x2d;butnot&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x3e;</code>

                            There are several more types of vulnerabilities that could exist. Message replays, where an attacker sends a message after its TTL has expired.

                            XSW attacks which take chunks of the SAML response and duplicate it and place it in various places within the response. In these scenarios the SP checks to see if a valid signed assertion/message/etc. exists and then processes the message. What if there are two assertions, the first valid, and signed but the second is not. Which will the application process? The first, second, last, cause it to crash?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What if the message is signed but not signed by the IDP? Perhaps the application is validating that the signature area is present, but not that it matches the data in the SAML response?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Yogi Vulnerable SP is not yet vulnerable to these attacks, but they're on the list.
